# ‚úàÔ∏è Telegram Bot with WebApp: Wheel of Fortune

1. **Create `.env` file**

```env
BOT_TOKEN=                 # Telegram bot token from @BotFather (keep secret)
CHANNEL_USERNAME=          # Channel username (must start with @)
WEBAPP_URL=                # HTTPS URL of your Telegram WebApp

STORE_API_KEY=             # Store API access key (keep secret)
STORE_API_URL=             # Endpoint to create promo codes in store
```

Explanation:
- `BOT_TOKEN`: Token from [@BotFather](https://telegram.me/BotFather)
- `CHANNEL_USERNAME`: Username of your Telegram channel ‚Äî make sure it starts with @, like @mychannel
- `WEBAPP_URL`: Public HTTPS URL of the backend (required for Telegram WebApp)

2. **Start with Docker Compose**

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

Both the bot and backend will be built and launched in their containers.
