# ‚úàÔ∏è Telegram Bot with WebApp: Wheel of Fortune

This project combines a Telegram bot and a FastAPI WebApp. Users who are subscribed to a specific Telegram channel can spin a wheel once per week to receive unique promo codes. The backend validates users via Telegram WebApp `initData`.

1. **Create `.env` file**

```env

```

Explanation:
- `BOT_TOKEN`: Token from [@BotFather](https://telegram.me/BotFather)
